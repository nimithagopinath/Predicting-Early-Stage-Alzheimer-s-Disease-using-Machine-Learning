# Predicting-Early-Stage-Alzheimer-s-Disease-using-Machine-Learning

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative
disorder that primarily affects older adults and leads to
dementia. Early prediction and treatment of AD are crucial for
maximizing efficacy and minimizing damage. Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) provides valuable insights into AD through the
visualization of brain tissue shrinkage. However, MRI analysis
encounters challenges such as complexity, subjectivity, and interrater
variability.
To address these limitations, various machine learning models,
including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine,
logistic regression, and AdaBoost, have been employed
to identify the optimal model for AD prediction. Performance
evaluation measures, such as Precision, Recall, and Accuracy,
are utilized to assess the models, with the Random Forest model
emerging as the most effective classifier, delivering exceptional
performance with an accuracy of 86.84%, a recall of 80%, and
an impressive AUC of 87.22%. This model demonstrated its
robustness in accurately identifying cases of Alzheimer’s disease.
Moreover, the study introduces additional metrics, including
the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and education level,
to enhance the model’s ability to differentiate between normal
healthy adults and individuals with Alzheimer’s. MMSE, a gold
standard for dementia determination, proves to be an indispensable
feature to include. Through the proficient utilization
of advanced machine learning techniques, this research aims to
enhance diagnostic accuracy and make substantial contributions
to the understanding and management of AD.
